          <p>
            I am <a className='link' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anoop-m-d-868099100">Anoop</a> , a full stack software programmer based out of Bangalore.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my decade long journey of developing software, every time I need to explore or work with apiâ€™s, I usually have to ask my colleagues to slack/email me a postman collection.
          </p>

          <p>
            Postman has a great collaboration platform for teams (it's gotten bloated these days though), but many companies stick to sharing collections via slack/email instead of opting for the paid plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            I searched for an opensource alternatives which companies can self host on their servers, but sadly none exist. Every opensource alternative (Insomnia, Hoppscotch.. etc) has a closed source component which restricts companies from self hosting.
          </p>

          <div className='ml-4 italic'>
            <p>1. Build end-to-end opensource platform that companies can self-host to enable developers to collaborate on api collections.</p>
            <p>2. BYOVC (Bring Your Own Version Control) - Allow developers to directly store there collections on top of their local filesystem. The collections are mirrored as folders and files on the filesystem</p>
